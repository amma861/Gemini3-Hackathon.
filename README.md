The "Aura-Align" Elevator Pitch
If you have to explain your project in one sentence (on LinkedIn or in an interview):
"Aura-Align uses Gemini 3’s multimodal reasoning and dynamic thinking levels to provide verifiable, culturally-grounded translations for West African languages."
# Gemini3-Hackathon.
Multimodal: It highlights that you understand the "native" power of Gemini 3 (not just treating it like a text box). Dynamic Reasoning: Using medium and high thinking levels shows you are optimizing for Latency vs. Accuracy. Context Window: It proves you understand how to handle "Big Data" without the complexity of RAG.
